# Probability of Default

This project involves constructing a machine learning model for Banca Massiccia, a hypothetical Italian bank, to predict the one-year probability of default (PD) for potential borrowers. The primary objective is to enhance the bank's underwriting processes, enabling more accurate risk-based pricing strategies for interest rates and underwriting fees. The focus is on leveraging real-world transaction data to improve loan decision-making and mitigate the portfolio default rate on individual loans.
